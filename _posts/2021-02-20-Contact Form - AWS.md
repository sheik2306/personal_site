## Adding Contact Form using AWS

### Amazon services API Gateway - Lamda Function - SES

Part of a serverless website hosted on github pages and generated with Jekyll,
Contact forms require dynamic data such as a database, api.

Using AWS serverless approach you pay by the usage and not per month.


[!Contact form using AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/create-dynamic-contact-forms-for-s3-static-websites-using-aws-lambda-amazon-api-gateway-and-amazon-ses/)


Create an AWS account, search for `lamda` - > `create function` -> from `blueprint` -> `helloword` in node.js  

<mark>Important!</mark> Inside the created function to add policies (SES policy)  

go to `Lamda -> function -> Configuration`  
Left side panel will have Permissions, Click on role name and add policies: choose SES policy or create custom policy


Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

or

```javascript
var a = 1;
var b = 2;
function sum (num1,num2){
  return num1+num2;
}
var result = sum(a,b);
```
